# Wearable Movement Assistant Device for Vision Impaired People

This is my bachelor's hardware design project. The project was completed along with my partner Moin Shahriyar and Sarhan Osman Bhuiya under the supervision of our professor Zunayeed Bin Zahir. <br> <br>

** The main aim of our project is to present an omnidirectional sonar vision device that can assist visually impaired individuals **

** Code can be found under the Code Named folder **

** Mechanism **

- There will be a wearable hat with sonar in eight direction which will cover 360˚. 
-	The sensors will be in such angle so that there will be created a circle of ultrasonic waves around the user which will cover from his neck to toe. 
-	To sense the location of the object there will be small vibration motor in eight direction also. So that the user can get clear sense about the object’s location. 
-	If the object is moving vibration motor will vibrate according to the direction. 
-	There will be extra 1 sonar at vertical direction to cover user’s head at straight direction. 
-	There will be extra 2 vibration motor one could be placed in user belt which will only vibrate when there will be any object at middle direction. Thinking of railway gate/parking gate. Only for those type of object, this motor will vibrate. 
-	The other vibration is for any hole ahead of user or think about stairs. The user will be notified if there is hollow ahead of him. Could be placed in hand.
-	There will be a mobile app along with the hardware which will start by voice command of the user, it will be able to set destination, provide voice assistant for walking etc.
-	Two bone conduction speaker will be provided behind the ear of the user (similar to Zungle Smart sunglass). These speakers will be attached with the main device. 
-	Most importantly as our sensors will be placed in an angle so that the app will be able to take base range for the sonar automatically. May be 30 sec of standing still after giving voice command for example: “Set my base range”. 
-	There could be one question “What will happen if the user sits after activating the project as there is a vibration function for middle range?”
-	Yeah there will be a command for that, like if the user say “I am sitting right now” the vibration will be turned off.
